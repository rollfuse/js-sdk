# conformance fixture (packages/evaluation-core/test/fixtures/
# bucketing-vectors.json, rollout-outcome-vectors.json) has drifted from
# rollfuse/sdk-conformance-fixtures, the public authoritative source (see
# that repo's README; it exists because the actual source of truth,
# apps/api's evaluation domain, lives in the private rollfuse/rollfuse
# monorepo and cannot be fetched by this repo's CI directly).

# harden-sdk-runtime task 1.3. Complements rollfuse/rollfuse's own
# scripts/check-conformance-fixture-drift.sh, which checks this repo's
# copy from the other direction; this one catches a copy edited directly
# in this repo without waiting for that CI to next run.
